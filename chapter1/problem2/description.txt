1.2) Check Permutation: Given two strings, write a method to decide if one is a permutation of the other.
In this problem we have to check that either two strings have the same all same characters or not.
For example ali and ila, one string is permutation to other because two strings have equal length and same characters.
We are assuming that Ali and ali are not permutation of each other because A and a are not same characters.
