Palindrome Permutation: Given a string, write a function to check if it is a permutation of
a palindrome. A palindrome is a word or phrase that is the same forwards and backwards. A
permutation is a rearrangement of letters. The palindrome does not need to be limited to just
dictionary words.

For the solution of problem we have to count number of characters in string which are odd number of times.
Example abbcc. In this string we have a = 1 , b = 2 and c = 2. Means only 1 character comes in odd number of times which is "a".
If in a given string we have only 1 or less than 1 odd count then we have palindrome which is permutation otherwise not.
