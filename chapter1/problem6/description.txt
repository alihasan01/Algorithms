1.6 String Compression: Implement a method to perform basic string compression using the counts
of repeated characters. For example, the string aabcccccaaa would become a2blc5a3. If the
"compressed" string would not become smaller than the original string, your method should return
the original string.

We can compare present character with next character if the present character is match with next character we move to next iteration.
If mismatch the we append that character with number of counts. Use string builder instead of string concatenation because string concatenation take extra space.
