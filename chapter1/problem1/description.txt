    Problem1.  Is Unique: Implement an algorithm to determine if a string has all unique characters?
	             In this problem we have to identify in a string either repetitive characters are present in a string or not.
	             If such repetitive characters are present we return false else if we have all unique characters in string then we return true. 
	             "Ali" have all unique characters so return true. "Hasan" don't have all unique characters so return false. 
               Test cases are also present to check the actual and expected solution.
