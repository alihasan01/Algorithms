One Away: There are three types of edits that can be performed on strings: insert a character,
remove a character, or replace a character. Given two strings, write a function to check if they are
one edit (or zero edits) away.

In this problem we can find the solution by categorizing solution in parts:
1. Replaceable
2. Editable
3. Removable
Editable and removable can be done with same function by comparing first string that it can be merge to the other or not.
Replaceable function is simple it can compare two strings and check that more if only at most one character is different in two string then solution is true otherwise false.
