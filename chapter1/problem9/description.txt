1.9 String Rotation: Assume you have a method i5Substring which checks ifone word is a substring
  	of another. Given two strings, 51 and 52, write code to check if 52 is a rotation of 51 using only one
  	call to isSubstring
	
In this problem we concatenate first string by itself and check that either it contains other string or not.
If contains then it means it rotate otherwise not.
