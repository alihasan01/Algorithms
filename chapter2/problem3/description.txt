2.3 Delete Middle Node: Implement an algorithm to delete a node in the middle 
In this solution what I have done is, take middle node in the function.
1. Take temporary node assign middle.next to that temporary node.
2. Assign  tmp.data to middle.data . Its mean we are assigning the data value of next to middle node to middle node.
3. Assigning middle.next to tmp.next it will do the job for maintaining link. Skip the useless node(node o be deleted)
