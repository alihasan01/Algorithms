2.1Remove Dups: Write code to remove duplicates from an unsorted linked list.
there are two solutions of this problem in first we simply use a hash table and store data values in it.
if the duplicate occurs we cant save it.

In second solution we iterate the whole linked list.
if duplicate found then we move to the link of next node and skip that duplicate value..
