2.2 Return Kth to Last: Implement an algorithm to find the kth to last element of a singly linked list.
In this problem we use two pointers both in start pointing to head;
we move first iterator to the kth element.
and further move first iterator to the end as well start another pointer from start.
this gives us length - k and hence we return kth to last element list
